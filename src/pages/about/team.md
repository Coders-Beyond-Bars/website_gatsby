##### Richard Kim

_Co-Founder & Director of Education_

Richard earned his master's in Media Arts and Sciences from the Media Lab, Massachusetts Institute of Technology where he specialized in research in artificial intelligence, machine ethics, and computational social science.  Prior to coming back to graduate school, Richard worked in the financial services industry in Tokyo, Japan and Los Angeles, California for approximately six years.  He obtained his Chartered Financial Analyst certification.  

Coming back to graduate school, Richard redirected his career focus to applied mathematics and computer science.  He completed his master’s in Information Technology with emphasis in Mathematics and Computation.  As a graduate student, Richard taught five courses in computer science and applied mathematics as teaching fellow at Harvard University. Subsequently, he enrolled in MIT Media Lab to pursue his doctorate.  

While at MIT, he volunteered to teach mathematics to incarcerated students at a correctional facility through the Petey Greene program.  From this experience as a volunteer tutor to incarcerate individuals, Richard was inspired to teach computer programming to incarcerated individuals.  Finding no appropriate channels or organization to make this a reality, Richard decided to launch Coders Beyond Bars in collaboration with Anjali Moorthy, a fellow Petey Greene program volunteer.

##### Anjali Moorthy

_Co-Founder & Executive Director_

Educator by profession and polymath by nature, Anjali earned her master's from the Harvard Graduate School of Education with a focus on Creative/Constructionist Learning, Social Entrepreneurship, and Instructional Design.  Before attending grad school, Anjali was a Corps Member at Teach for India, where she worked as an educator and mentor to 200 at-risk adolescents, and then as a founder teacher in a charter secondary school. In those roles, she worked on experiential learning, student leadership, social-emotional learning, teacher training, and community engagement.

She believes that education sits at the root of the solutions to most global issues like poverty, and it has the power to catalyze a change in the trajectory of one's life if done right. Her focus is on working with at-risk youth and understanding what education needs to look like to ensure their self-sufficiency, agency, and success in the economy and society.

While at Harvard, she also volunteered through the Petey Greene program as a Teaching Assistant in a medium security men's correctional facility in Massachusetts. During this time, the students at the facility left a strong impression on her with their passion for learning, grasp of concepts, openness to challenges, and desire to make a change. This experience led her on the path of the criminal justice movement, and using education as a tool to break the cycle of recidivism.
