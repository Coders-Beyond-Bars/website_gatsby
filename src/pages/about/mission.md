###### Mission Statement
Empowering incarcerated individuals to transform their own lives by educating
them in high-tech skills and preparing them for careers in high-tech industries
for successful re-entry into society


###### About Us

Coders Beyond Bars, Inc. (CBB) is a not-for-profit organization in Massachusetts
with the mission of educating incarcerated individuals in high-tech skills such
as coding and preparing them for successful careers in high-tech skills where
they can utilize those skill [cont'd]

Before the invent of the printing press and broadening of public education to increase literacy in developing countries, the power and wealth difference between those who can read and write, such as priests, scribes, and aristocrats, versus those who could not, the commoners, were quite stark.  Similar to literacy in medieval period, coding has become a powerful skill in the 21st job market.  Those who possess the ability to read and write code have the ability to participate in the new economy as producers of digital technology while the other remain as their consumers.  As stated in the Background section of this report
Unfortunately, educational opportunities in coding are far from broadly accessible across all communities in the US.   Many incarcerated individuals are locked out, literally and figuratively, from educational opportunities and resources to educate themselves about coding.  Their families and communities that they belong to do not have the knowledge and the know-how to properly utilize free and affordable resources online.  If educational opportunities in coding is not more broadly accessible to more communities, including the incarcerated, then coding and technology industry has the potential of polarizing income and wealth inequality.

Our goal is to [cont'd]


###### What We Do

####### We Educate
We are educators.  We offer educational programs inside correctional facilities for incarcerated individuals.  We design curriculums
Today, we offer three educational programs (see Programs)
We abstract away theoretical mathematics.  We offer hands-on approach to coding.  
Whether in our data science or web development, we  real-world projects whether

####### We Connect
We connect with leaders in tech industries to inform them about the problems in mass incarceration, diversity and inclusion in the tech industry.  Today, tech industries are overwhelmingly dominated by White (to some extent Asian) employees.  The lack of gender and racial diversity has been brought up by many media outlets [cite]
We act as a bridge between the leaders in the tech industry.  Through our educational program in correctional facilities, we connect the tech industry with an alternative talent pool different from what one can find in a typical four-year college graduate.  For instance, in Massachusetts, â€¦.



####### We Inspire

Our goal is to educate the next generation of engineers, developers, and scientists.  We work with youth centers (i.e. juvenile detention centers) to inspire the next generation of engineer.  Through educational programming and mentorship, we guide our students for furthering their education.  We inspire them to enroll in colleges and pursue further education in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics through two-year or four-year colleges.

Moreover, we aim to open educational programs outside correctional facilities geared toward individuals in the economically marginalized urban communities.  With the help of alumni community formed through our educational programs in the correctional facilities, we plan to inspire those in the economically marginalized urban communities to pursue careers in tech industries and education in STEM fields.
