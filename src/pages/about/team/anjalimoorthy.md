Educator by profession and polymath by nature, Anjali earned her master's from the Harvard Graduate School of Education with a focus on Creative/Constructionist Learning, Social Entrepreneurship, and Instructional Design. Before attending grad school, Anjali was a Corps Member at Teach for India, where she worked as an educator and mentor to 200 at-risk adolescents, and then as a founder teacher in a charter secondary school. In those roles, she worked on experiential learning, student leadership, social-emotional learning, teacher training, and community engagement.

She believes that education sits at the root of the solutions to most global issues like poverty, and it has the power to catalyze a change in the trajectory of one's life if done right. Her focus is on working with at-risk youth and understanding what education needs to look like to ensure their self-sufficiency, agency, and success in the economy and society.

While at Harvard, she also volunteered through the Petey Greene program as a Teaching Assistant in a medium security men's correctional facility in Massachusetts. During this time, the students at the facility left a strong impression on her with their passion for learning, grasp of concepts, openness to challenges, and desire to make a change. This experience led her on the path of the criminal justice movement, and using education as a tool to break the cycle of recidivism.
