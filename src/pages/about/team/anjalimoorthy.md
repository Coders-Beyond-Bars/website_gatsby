Anjali earned her master's from the Harvard Graduate School of Education with a focus on Creative/Constructionist Learning, Social Entrepreneurship, and Instructional Design. While at Harvard, she also volunteered through the Petey Greene program as a Teaching Assistant in a medium security men's correctional facility in Massachusetts. During this time, the students at the facility left a strong impression on her with their passion for learning, grasp of concepts, openness to challenges, and desire to make a change. This experience led her on the path of the criminal justice movement, and using education as a tool to break the cycle of recidivism. Anjali was a Corps Member at Teach for India, where she worked as an educator and mentor to 200 at-risk adolescents, and then as a founder teacher in a charter secondary school. In those roles, she worked on experiential learning, student leadership, social-emotional learning, teacher training, and community engagement.
