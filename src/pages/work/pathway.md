##### 1. High-tech Education
We offer educational courses in technical skills such as data analytics, web development, video game design, and database management.  We leverage the best available online resources for instructions in coding and data analytics, and complement them with course facilitators with proven track record of professional and pedagogical experience.   

##### 2. Real World Projects
Collaborating with local technology companies, we design our courses with real-world problems. These projects enable our students to build up their professional portfolio of projects to showcase their talent to prospective employers in the tech industry.

##### 3. Re-entry Transition
We help our students prepare for career and life outside of correctional facilities by coaching them soft skills such as interview skills, resume writing, business ethics, etc. through one-to-one mentoring and group workshops.

##### 4. Internship
Through collaboration with our member companies, we offer full-time, paid internships to our students upon their release. This enables the students to continue their education through on-the-job training and relieve them of the pressure to find employment after being released from correctional facilities.

##### 5. Career & Life Mentorship
We continuously engage our students after their release and follow up on their careers and transition to life outside. We provide one-to-one counseling as well as group workshops on various topics including personal finance and entrepreneurship.

##### 6. Alumni Community
We strive to build a community of alumni who completed our program and are working professionals in the technology industry. We hold monthly coding nights where the alumni can come together, code and discuss in a collaborative environment. We encourage collaboration and entrepreneurship through the alumni network.
