In summer of 2018, my friend and colleague, Anjali Moorthy, and I launched Coders Beyond Bars as a program under MIT's [The Educational Justice Institute](https://www.teji.mit.edu/).  Anjali and I had been volunteering as mentors at the [Petey Greene](https://www.peteygreene.org/).  


Our motivation for naming the program was straightforward.  WE wanted to teach coding (aka computer programming) to returning citizens serving time behind bars.  We encouraged our students to use coding as a means to rise above their circumstances and attain career opportunities that could help them in their reentry process.
